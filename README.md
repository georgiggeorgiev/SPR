TU-Sofia system programming course work. This source code represents a client-server based system which allows the client to manipulate string-integer value pairs stored in a trie data structure on the server.

This software is only designed to operate on POSIX-compliant operating systems. To build use the provided makefile. Server must be running to enable the client portion of the software to start.

NOTE: Due to the way the trie data structure is implemented it may only hold lowercase English alphabet characters as keys.
